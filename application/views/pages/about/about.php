        <h5 class="h5 fw-bold text-primary2">Our Mission</h5>
        <p class="line-height1 opacity-75 pe-md-5 mt-4">Nursing Home Suit serves the State of Georgia as the best resource to learn about your rights regarding nursing home injuries. The law protects you and your loved ones from injuries sustained in a nursing home. There is no excuse for a healthcare provider to harm a resident. Our plague of nursing home negligence is preventable and only the law can hold the skilled nursing facilities accountable. 
          <br /><br />
          We created Nursing Home Suit to help families navigate the complex legal process of assessing whether they may have a law suit, finding a competent attorney, and providing the connection to bring justice to you. We only network with specialists with a deep history of medical malpractice, trial experience, and demonstrate the skills necessary to win a lawsuit against a well-financed nursing home. 
          <br /><br />
          You are in good hands. Together we can deliver justice and change the industry for the better.
